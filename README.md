# Reddit

So far this lets you search reddit posts and subreddits, and view posts and subreddits. It uses the reddit API to fetch the posts. It is built using React, React Router, and react-masonry-css.

Next I plan on:
 adding threading to the comments so you can see what's being replied to.
 adding a loading spinner.
 making the homepage of the app show r/popular posts.
 displaying the image of the post on the post page.
 adding videos to the searchposts and displaypost pages.
 adding marked-react to the comments so you can see markdown.
 managing some of the state with rtk.
