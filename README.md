# Reddit

So far this lets you search reddit posts and subreddits, and view posts and subreddits. It uses the reddit API to fetch the posts. It is built using React, React Router, and react-masonry-css.

Next I plan on adding threading to the comments so you can see what's being replied to.

Current bugs are that when you press the enter key in the search box it refreshes the page and you lose your search. I also want to add a loading spinner.
